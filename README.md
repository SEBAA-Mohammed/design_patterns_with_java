# Java Design Patterns Practice

This repository contains hands-on implementations of various design patterns in Java. Each folder in the root directory is named after a specific design pattern and contains a standalone Maven project dedicated to that pattern.

## Purpose

This repository was created to practice and demonstrate the implementation of classic design patterns in Java. Each project is self-contained and can be explored independently.

## Structure

The root directory contains a separate folder for each design pattern, for example:

```
abstract_factory/
bridge/
builder_karimi/
chain_of_responsibility/
command/
composite/
decorateur/
facade/
factory_method/
fllyweight/
interpreter/
iterator/
mediator/
momento/
observer/
prototype/
proxy/
singleton/
state/
strategie/
template_method/
visitor/
```

Each folder is a Maven project with the following structure:

- `src/main/` — Contains the main source code and demo classes for the pattern.
- `src/test/` — (If present) Contains unit tests.
- `pom.xml` — Maven configuration for the project.

## Running the Demos

To run a demo for any design pattern, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the main class located in the `src/main/` directory. Each demo is designed to showcase the core idea and usage of the pattern.

## Requirements

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven
- Your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired pattern's folder in your IDE
3. Build and run the main class in `src/main/` to see the pattern in action

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of design patterns in Java!
